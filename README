Prints the next time that each job in a crontab will run. Eventually, I'd like to make this a python library for parsing crontabs, as well as a more general utility for analyzing crontabs.
Usage: cronparser.py [-h] [--date DATE] [--time TIME] crontab


To run the test suite, run python -m unittest or python main.py

Requires Python 3.4
